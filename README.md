output comes from a spot account


addresses are taken from addresses.txt

for APIKEY and SECRETKEY, go to https://bingx.com/ru-ru/account/api/ and create an api (be sure to label it “Withdrawal”!)

AMOUNT : enter the number of tokens to be output, taking into account the bingx commissions 

COIN : write the ticker of the coin.

NETWORK : enter the network. TRC20, BEP20, etc. (the network you need should be checked on the bingx output page)

SLEEP1, SLEEP2 = 30, 60 : instead of 30 and 60 specify your rest range between outputs in seconds.

If the code does not work or if you have suggestions for improvement, open a new issue
